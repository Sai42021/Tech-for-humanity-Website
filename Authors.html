    <h1>Authors</h1>
    <h2>Format of articles</h2>
    <p>
        Tech for humanity publishes original research in two formats: Article and Registered Report. For Registered Reports, see section below. In most cases, we do not impose strict limits on word count or page number. However, we strongly recommend that you write concisely and stick to the following guidelines:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Articles should ideally be no more than 11 typeset pages</li>
            <li>The main text should be no more than 4,500 words (not including Abstract, Methods, References and figure legends)</li>
            <li>The title should be no more than 20 words</li>
            <li>The abstract should be no more than 200 words</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Please do not include any references in your Abstract. Make sure it serves both as a general introduction to the topic and as a brief, non-technical summary of the main results and their implications.</p>

    <h2>Manuscript</h2>
    <p>
        Your manuscript text file should start with a title page that shows author affiliations and contact information, identifying the corresponding author with an asterisk. We recommend that each section includes an introduction of referenced text that expands on the background of the work. Some overlap with the Abstract is acceptable.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>For the main body of the text, there are no specific requirements. You can organise it in a way that best suits your research. However, the following structure will be suitable in many cases:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduction</li>
        <li>Results (with subheadings)</li>
        <li>Discussion (without subheadings)</li>
        <li>Methods</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    You should then follow the main body of text with:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>References (limited to 60 references, though not strictly enforced)</li>
        <li>Acknowledgements (optional)</li>
        <li>Author contributions (names must be given as initials)</li>
        <li>Data availability statement (mandatory)</li>
        <li>Additional Information (including a Competing Interests Statement)</li>
        <li>Figure legends (these are limited to 350 words per figure)</li>
        <li>Tables (maximum size of one page)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Please note, footnotes should not be used.
    <br>
    You may include a limited number of uncaptioned molecular structure graphics and numbered mathematical equations if necessary. Display items are limited to 8 (figures and/or tables). However, to enable typesetting of papers, we advise making the number of display items commensurate with your overall word length. So, for Articles of 2,000 words or less, we suggest including no more than 4 figures/tables. Please note that schemes should not be used and should be presented as figures instead.
    <br>
    Your submission must also include:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>A cover letter</li>
        <li>Individual figure files and optional supplementary information files</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    For first submissions (i.e. not revised manuscripts), you may incorporate the manuscript text and figures into a single file up to 3 MB in size. Whilst Microsoft Word is preferred we also accept LaTeX, or PDF format. Figures can be inserted in the text at the appropriate positions, or grouped at the end.
    <br>
    Supplementary information should be combined and supplied as a single separate file, preferably in PDF format.
    <br>
    
    <h2>References</h2>
    We don’t copy edit your references. Therefore, it’s essential you format them correctly, as they will be linked electronically to external databases where possible. At Scientific Reports, we use the standard Nature referencing style. So, when formatting your references, make sure they:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Run sequentially (and are always numerical).</li>
        <li>Sit within square brackets.</li>
        <li>Only have one publication linked to each number.</li>
        <li>Only include papers or datasets that have been published or accepted by a named publication, recognised preprint server or data repository (if you include any preprints of accepted papers in your reference list, make sure you submit them with the manuscript).</li>
        <li>Include published conference abstracts and numbered patents, if you wish.</li>
        <li>Don’t include grant details and acknowledgements.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Sorry, we cannot accept BibTeX (.bib) bibliography files for references. If you are making your submission by LaTeX, it must either contain all references within the manuscript .tex file itself, or (if you’re using the Overleaf template) include the .bbl file generated during the compilation process as a ‘LaTeX supplementary file’ (see the "Manuscripts" section for more details).
    <br>
    In your reference list, you should:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Include all authors unless there are six or more, in which case only the first author should be given, followed by 'et al.'.</li>
        <li>List authors by last name first, followed by a comma and initials (followed by full stops) of given names.</li>
        <li>Use Roman text for Article and dataset titles, with only the first word of the title having an initial capital and written exactly as it appears in the work cited, ending with a full stop.</li>
        <li>Use italics for book titles, giving all words in the title an initial capital.</li>
        <li>Use italics for journal and data repository names, abbreviating them according to common usage (with full stops).</li>
        <li>Use bold for volume numbers and the subsequent comma.</li>
        <li>Give the full page range (or article number), where appropriate.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    Please keep any acknowledgements brief, and don’t include thanks to anonymous referees and editors, or any effusive comments. You may acknowledge grant or contribution numbers. You should also acknowledge assistance from medical writers, proof-readers and editors.
